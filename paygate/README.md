```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Create a new payment using PayPal

```go
func createPaymentHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  // Parse request body to get payment details
  var payment paymentgateway.Payment
  err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&payment)
  if err != nil {
    http.Error(w, "Failed to parse request body", http.StatusBadRequest)
    return
  }

  // Create a new payment using PayPal
  paymentID, err := gateway.PayPal.CreatePayment(payment)
  if err != nil {
    http.Error(w, "Failed to create PayPal payment", http.StatusInternalServerError)
    return
  }

  // Return payment ID to the client
  response := paymentgateway.PaymentResponse{ID: paymentID, Status: "created"}
  json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(response)
}
```

### Example 2: Execute a payment using Stripe

```go
func executePaymentHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  // Parse payment ID from query parameter
  paymentID := r.URL.Query().Get("paymentID")

  // Execute a payment using Stripe
  err := gateway.Stripe.ExecutePayment(paymentID)
  if err != nil {
    http.Error(w, "Failed to execute Stripe payment", http.StatusInternalServerError)
    return
  }

  // Respond to the client
  fmt.Fprintf(w, "Payment executed for payment ID: %s", paymentID)
}
```
